#dbManager
  
  This Java application enables the user to manage a table in a mySQL database. The GUI is written in german. It can be used for any MySQL database that has integer primary keys;
  however, input validation (StringInputValidation Class) for new or updated entries is based on data for persons.
  Its impractical for databases with many tables as the user can only switch between tables and not search for them directly.
  After selecting the server and database via a menu, the user can:
  
  - Switch between tables in the database
  - Open another window to search for entries in the currently selected table using a primary key or column data (exact or partial)
  - Open another window to show details for a single entry, edit data for that entry or delete it.
    This window will also be used to display the entries found via the search function and can switch to the next/previous entry in the table or search results
  - Open another window to add an entry to the currently selected table (inputs will be validated)
  - Delete the selected entry from the current table (without opening another window)
  - View history table of added and deleted entries if the according tables have the necessary triggers
  - Disconnect from the database to set up a new connection
  
  Attention: The password/user data is not encrypted. Be cautious when using this for sensitive data!
  
  This was my first non-trivial piece of software after a few months of Java, i wrote it for my computer science class before i even knew about git.
  It could be improved quite a bit (the constructors do way too much), but I’ll leave it as is to always remind me where I started.
